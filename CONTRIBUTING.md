## Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to TuyAPI! We welcome all kinds of contributions, whether it's a small README fix or a new feature.

Please take a moment to read through this short guide so both the core maintainers' time and your time can be better utilized.

## What you can do

Really, anything you want that's in the scope of this project (you may also want to check out the [@TuyAPI](https://github.com/tuyaapi) organization for other cool projects you could contribute to).

Some ideas:

- Improve documentation
- Track down bugs
- Write tutorials for new users
- Add a new feature
- Respond to new [issues](https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) that are asking for support and not reporting a bug
- Improve test coverage
- Refactor and clean up existing code

## Expectations

Before making any major changes to a user-facing interface or adding a new feature, please open an [issue](https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) with a description of the changes you're planning on making.  Getting feedback before you begin programming ensures that the maintainers' time as well as yours is used more efficiently.

**Before you open a Pull Request, make sure all tests pass!!!! (see next section).**

## Getting started

You're ready to start programming?  Great, here's what you should do:

1. Fork this repository to your account (click the **Fork** button at the top right).
2. Clone your forked repository to your computer with `git clone {forked repo url}`
3. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
4. Make a new branch with `git branch`. If you're adding a new feature, use a `feature-*` prefix (ex. `feature-contributing`). If you're fixing a bug, use a `bugfix-*` prefix. Use your best judgement on anything else.
5. Make your changes. (Tip: you can use a file named `dev.js` as a local playground to test your new code in, since the file is ignored by Git.)
6. Ensure all tests pass with `npm test`. If you get a lot of style-related errors, consider running `npx xo --fix` to automatically fix most of them.
7. Commit your changes with `git commit -a`. Be sure to describe the changes you've made in a clear and concise way.
8. Push the changes to your repo with `git push origin master`.
9. Open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/compare) to the **base: master** branch. Click **"compare across forks"** and select the master branch of your fork.

Expect to hear back within a week or so (usually sooner). Thank you for your contribution!
